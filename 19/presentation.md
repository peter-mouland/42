# [fit] WTF to do with
# [fit] Ethics?

^WTF Ethics?

---

![filtered](/Users/rob/Desktop/Ethically Driven Development/images/coffee.jpg) 

^ Every day, very often without thinking about it, we make ethical decisions.
Getting an espresso from Butter Beans instead of Starbucks might just mean you didn’t want to cross the road or it might mean you have an unconscious preference for small retailers.

^ Other ethics deeper, more complex. 
Culture might shelter you from them.
Might presume it's handled at a level above you
it’s not your concern. You work on the tickets that appear.

^Risk flippant about something incredibly serious, 
think of horror inflicted by “I was just following orders”.

^So what ethical questions do we face in this business?

#[fit]Honesty
#[fit]Discretion
^2 areas that leap out to me are Honesty and Discretion.
Our People and Legal team give training and guidance on NOTHS expectations .

^Take aways?

---

#Honesty 
*Transparency of action and intent | Awareness of being influenced.*

#Discretion
*Consideration of the sensitivity of the data we handle.*

^Honesty is transparent about what and why you do.
Also recognise dishonesty and how to respond.
^Discretion is respect for sensitivity for personal data.

^So what does this have to do with being a Developer/UX/PO…?

#WHY

^Let's stand back and set the stage'
^Better experience,  return more often, buy more things.
^Partners sell more products, we make more money in order to continue the cycle.
^DELICATE BALANCE between  virtuous supporting of partners & the needs of the company. 
cost of business, value to shareholders and investors.
^How do we know if what we do works?

#Measuring
![filtered](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Steel_ruler_closeup.jpg)

- User interaction
- Analytics
- Reviews

^Of those, whats the most immediate and understandable indicator? 
Analytics.
Going to use it  test case for ethical decisions at developer level.

---

#Analytics

1. How much do we pay for GA?
2. Where can a user opt-out of analytics collection?
3. Who has read the terms and conditions of usage for GA?

^What system do we use to collect usage data?
^1. We pay with our users data. "but it’s anonymised" COME BACK
^2. they can’t
^3. They’re interesting.

*Although names, addresses and other information directly linked to card owners had been scrubbed from the data set, de Montjoye and his colleagues could pick out* __*90% of individuals*__ *if they knew the date and location of* __*just four of their credit-card transactions*__.[^1]

^ Credit Cards - de Montjoye, Radaelli, Singh, Pentland. Science 2015.
^ How does that sit with our concept of discretion with our users data?

^This is where ethics meets development. 
Your manager comes to you and asks you to complete a ticket that adds Analytics tracking to the website. He tells you to use `AcmeAnalytics`. 
“it’s free, it’s cool, all the kids are using it”

---

#Do you...

- Do you *presume* they made the decision and *defer* to their judgement?
- Do you *investigate* the t’s & c’s?
- Do you *push back* if you think the service is a violation of our commitment to user data?

^What do you do?
You’re not responsible for you managers action, you’re responsible for yours.
I’ll come back to what that can mean later.
^OK so you do push back & you get listened to.
What are the options?

^1. Override you 
The only question here is what do you do? What do your ethic allow you to feel comfortable with?

^2.  other solutions
There are other solutions that do not profit from the data gathered themselves, but they are paid services. 

^3. Find another way to collect data
Analytics is not the only way to do this.

^How happy is the the company with the cost of the service vs the cost to their customers privacy?
^It’s not the only tool we use that ethical consequences…

#Javascript tracking code?
#Emailing policy?
#Agreements with 3rd parties?
#Payments data?


^Do you know the process taken to evaluate the javascript tracking we use? 
^With our emailing policy? 
^How much tacit approval have you given over without checking?
^You have to ask yourself a question… what do you believe is right?

#[fit]Ask yourself a question

^of yourself: What do I believe?.
^of the company: What do you believe.
^If you don’t know what you believe is right then you might be at risk 
Why?

#previously in Pivotal...

- They trusted the process has been done above them
- “I don’t care that much”
- “It’s not my problem”
- “I’m paid to build this not work out all the legal stuff”.

^Let’s return to the previous example of a developer being asked to implement AcmeAnalytics product.
^That’s cool until one day there’s a problem.

#The next day...
- They have read the Ts & Cs 
- They don’t like how data is being used.

^ They have read the terms and conditions of AcmeAnalytics.io terms 
^ They don’t like how their usage and purchasing data is being used.
^ They ask where the opt-out option is in the site/app.

#One week later...

- AcmeAnalytics™ licence revoked.
- Data lost.

^A week later the customer does not return. But there lawyer does.
They sue for not adhering to the privacy policy for customer data.
AcmeAnalytics wished to revoke the license to use their software for not adhering to the terms of the licence.
The company wants to be seen to take this seriously.

#Suddenly...

- Internal investigation
- 'git blame'
- Fine print

^Everyone looking at developer
^Re-asking questions he gave casual answers to.
^Could well be the target for the lawsuit?, T&C specify individual making use of the service.

---

#Extreme example? 
#__*yes!*__
#Likely? 
#__*it's happened...*__

^but it’s something to think about each day with each piece of work...

---

#[fit]summary

- "What process led to me being asked to do this?"
- "Do I know the consequence of my actions?"
- "What do I believe in?"

^Act on the answers you give yourself.'
