#### 12 :: Making Code Fly: Load Testing Web Applications
"No battle plan survives contact with the enemy", they say. Likewise, popular web application often need optimisation when they encounter real World traffic. Being able to identify & fix performance bottlenecks in our running applications is a critical skill of any modern software engineer, and is a cornerstone of Site Reliability Engineering. In this talk I'll go through why performance is the job of a developer, how to test web application stacks, what tools exist to monitor production performance, how to identify the effect of bottlenecks (and their possible causes!). Finally, I'll talk about what options a developer can take to improve performance. This will be a whistle-stop tour but the extensive supporting notes will help you as you go about trying to conquer the World.
