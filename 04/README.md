A fast webpage improves both user experience and SEO but how do you make a heavy webpage fast without removing content? Sometimes browser caching, image optimisation and file minification aren't enough, we need to start looking at page performance differently. Part of the way Google measures page speed involves above-the-fold load. To a user this could be seen as perceived load as the only content they can see has been loaded. By focusing on our above-the-fold content we improve perceived page speeds and become more favoured by the SEO Gods. This is a process known as optimising the critical rendering path, this talk explains how it's done.
