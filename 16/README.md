# 16 :: Breaking down the monolith

## Abstract
Working with a legacy monolithic codebase can try the patience of any developer. No matter your level of experience, you will spend a lot of your time looking at code asking questions like "WTF DOES THIS DO?!?" and "WHY IS THIS SO COMPLICATED?".  Pretty soon your whole team is working at a snail's pace, the business is slowed down by tech debt, and you decide that maybe it's time to kill the beast that you have collectively created - or at the very least, break it down into smaller pieces.

This is a motivational self-help talk aimed pretty much at myself and developers who, like me, work with a monolithic codebase on a daily basis.

## Bio
I'm a Software Engineer at notonthehighstreet.com. I spend most of my time wrestling a monolithic Rails app into submission.  So far, it's winning.
