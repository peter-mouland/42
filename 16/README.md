# 16 :: Breaking down the monolith

## Abstract
Working with a legacy monolithic codebase can try the patience of any developer. No matter your level of experience, you will spend a lot of your time looking at code asking questions like "WTF DOES THIS DO?!?" and "WHY IS THIS SO COMPLICATED?".  Pretty soon your whole team is working at a snail's pace, everyone is frustrated, and you decide that maybe it's time to kill the beast that you have collectively created - or at the very least, break it down into smaller pieces.

This is a self-help talk. Most of it will be spend talking about how to manage your ability to deal with an insane codebase under tight deadlines with an impatient boss who is expecting you to deliver value to the business.  There will be a few code examples, but mostly in the context of helping us approach them in ways different from the usual developer attitude of "let's get it done ASAP".

## Bio
I'm a Software Engineer at notonthehighstreet.com.  I mostly write Ruby at the moment, though I'm interested in Golang, Elixir and Crystal. I spend most of my time wrestling a monolithic Rails app into submission.  So far, it's winning.
