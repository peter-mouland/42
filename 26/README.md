# 01 :: Give Go a go
Go programming language has been around for a little more than 7 years now and yet many people have never experienced just how amazing it is. What is worse is, when people have tried the language but never got past the learning curve to actually start to appreciate it.

In this talk, I want to help both group to understand what the language is and some of the common misunderstandings. I will also take a look at the most common use cases of the language.

Once you’ve seen just how amazing the Go programming language is and understand just can what you do with it. You’d understand why the language is not “Go-ing” anywhere provided with how the industry has taken it to the heart.

In addition of this, you’ll walk away knowing that the Go community is the best and you’ll be missing out if you don’t give Go a go.
