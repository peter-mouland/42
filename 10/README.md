# 10 :: Community matters
At this time and age, technology makes (almost) everything possible and there’s digital solution to almost anything. To come up with innovative ideas, creative ideas, the next wave in technology that can solve problem for broader society, I truly believe that we need diversity in thoughts, perspectives and energy.

Our community is not that diverse, in fact some are not inclusive at all. We need to understand better why we need to be inclusive and work on nurturing underrepresented groups within our community. Because, software development is a creative process, it is about creation, from the people by the people to the people. It is only natural if the end products would be biased by the creator’s perspective of the world and society.

WWG, GoBridge, Code:Bar and many more organisations out there helps foster diversity in Technology by teaching technical skills to underrepresented groups in safe and inclusive environments. Being involved in your local communities means helping others while improving yourself, your team and your utopia.
