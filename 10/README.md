# 10 :: Community matters
In this time and age, technology makes (almost) everything possible and there is a digital solution to almost anything. To come up with innovative ideas, creative ideas, the next wave in technology that can solve problem for broader society; I truly believe that we need diversity in thoughts, perspectives and energy.

Our community is not that diverse; in fact, some groups are not inclusive at all. We need to understand better why it’s important to be inclusive and work on nurturing underrepresented groups within our community. Because software development is a creative process, it is about creation, from the people by the people to the people. It is only natural for end products to be biased by the creator’s perspectives of the world and society.

WWG, WWC, GoBridge, Code:Bar and many more organisations out there help foster diversity in Technology by teaching technical skills and leadership skills to underrepresented groups in safe and inclusive environments. Being involved in your local communities means helping others while improving yourself, your team and the society you live in.
