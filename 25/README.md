# 25 :: How good dependency management can make your tests faster
We've all heard the buzzwords: SOLID, high cohesion, loose coupling, dependency inversion (and injection)... In this talk we'll get down to the real world and see how good use of some of these concepts can make our lives as developers easier (and the lives of our fellow coworkers too!). We'll see common pitfalls that can slow down our test suites, and how to avoid them.

Because if there's something you can't escape, that's writing tests for your code. If you can not only write those tests faster, but also make them run faster, you'll become a better developer.
