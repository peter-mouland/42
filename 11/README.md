#### 11 :: Easy setup

> It is not ok to ask me to follow a 100 step process to compile your code

## Bio

### David Kelley

An avid Docker enthusiast, so naturally its my mantra and spoken no less than 50 times per day.

I have previously worked (and currently work on) projects that have 10+ steps to get setup, make a whole bunch of assumptions about your OS, environment, way of working and generally make hard work out of something that should be simple and reproducible. Lets not even begin to discuss the _stackoverflow-ing_ involved when something goes wrong.

Like countless other developers, I enjoy and even feel more compelled to contribute to projects that make it easy for me to develop with. If it's painful, the result is simple: that bug fix, code improvement or perhaps an entire feature won't be contributed, because I can't test it.

> `WIP`

Setting up a project needs to be painless, fast and most importantly, easy. Seriously, like, one `command`, OK?

Some thoughts...

0. No, I don't want to install Homebrew.
0. Ich spreche kein Englisch. Wie setze ich ein?
0. Why do you assume I have $1500 to buy a Macbook? Your well-written README is totally useless.
0. I already have MySQL, Memcached, Redis, Kafka, Cassandra, Postgres, Spark, Hadoop and Accumulo installed. No, I won't install Mongo!
0. Oh dear, your project won't build on my machine -- better open an issue!
0. I'd love to contribute, but I don't have 6 hours to follow 100 instructions.
